<form onsubmit="check()">
    <label for="red">Guess:</label>
    <input id="guess" type="text" />
    <button type="submit">Check</button>
</form>
<p>This is the beginning of how I added a guessing 
    game to my ePortfolio</p>
<script type="text/javascript">
theNumber = Math.floor(Math.random()*100)
check = function() {
    guess = document.querySelector("#guess").value;
    if (guess == theNumber) {
        alert("you are right!")
    } else {
        if (guess < theNumber) {
            alert("you are too low")
        } else {
            alert("you are too high")
        }
    }
}
