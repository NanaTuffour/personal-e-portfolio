My favorite topic from this class so far has been the application of math in the world of data science. Mrs. Stupavsky gave me useful advice about the importance of increasing my range of skills to become a good data analyst. I discovered I need to learn more about software such as SQL, Oracle, Tableau, and Jupyter Notebooks and practice using them since they are heavily used in data analytics. I also learned the importance of networking and finding knowledgeable people in data science because I can ask questions and get advice from people who have real experience in the field.
